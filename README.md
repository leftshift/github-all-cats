# GitHub All Cats

Everyone is a cat!

Find it at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jghckmfappcicbpehdfcdjagjppimonh/ or download it here and load it as an 'unpacked extension'.

Github All Cats is a Google chrome extension that adds a button to toggle showing github usernames or randomly chosen adjectives and cat names. This lets you anonymize other github users and makes you judge their code and not their name or looks.

Based on [github-real-names](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/github-real-names), but does quite the opposite.
