# GitHub All Cats

Everyone is a cat!

Still early work-in-progress!

Github All Cats is a Google chrome extension that adds a button to toggle showing github usernames or randomly chosen adjectives and cat names (and soon images). This helps you anonymize the names of other github users and makes you judge their code and not their name or looks.

Based on [github-real-names](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/github-real-names), but does quite the opposite.

## How to build

No building required.
